PHP Version  | Status  | Require
------------ | ------  | -------
PHP 7.2      | In Dev  | Composer

> Install Library:

` composer require ethical/telematici-php`

> Access Google Cloud Console & Enable API

Integrates Google Vision features, including image labeling, face, logo,
and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and detection
of explicit content, into applications. (See [Enable Cloud Vision API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/vision.googleapis.com?q=vision&id=957e5f12-b03d-4788-9f56-bcdd4dd51f5a&project=resolute-cat-230917))

> Authenticating to a Cloud API Service

To allow your application code to use a Cloud API, 
you will need to set up the proper credentials for your application 
to authenticate its identity to the service and to obtain authorization
to perform tasks. (See [Generate Api Key File](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/wps/portal/entrate/servizi))

> Start Ethical Object:

```
$telematici = new Ethical\Telematici\Service('path/to/serviceaccountkey/project-name.json');
```
ðŸ’» The class will connect via api to Google Cloud Api Vision Services (environment variables)
> Check Valid Fiscal Code Exist

```
if($telematici->validCF('FISCALCODE'))
{
    // Fiscal Code Valid !
} else {
    // Fiscal Code Not Valid
}
```
ðŸš€ The system checks the tax code by confirming the captcha through Api Vision

> Check Valid Vat Number
```
if($telematici->validPIVA('VATNUMBER'))
{
    // Vat Number Valid !
} else {
    // Vat Number Not Valid
}
```
ðŸŽ‚ The system checks the vat number by confirming the captcha through Api Vision

> Return Data Response
```
if($telematici->validPIVA('VATNUMBER'))
{
    echo $telematici->response();
}

if($telematici->validCF('FISCALCODE'))
{
    echo $telematici->response();
}
```
ðŸ‘Œ This method return a response data of result (beta)

> Work With Cycles And Log
```
$log->info('+1');
```
ðŸ‘¤ How does the script work?

Simple, the script tries to read the contents of the captcha until it finds a string, then passes the string to the captcha, if it fails it runs the loop again.

The cycles are saved via LOG and this can also last 8/9 seconds and generate about 20/30 calls Api Vision to be able to find a match.
